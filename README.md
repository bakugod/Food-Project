# Easy start
I am testing my skills at API creation and some drag and drop features realised with VueJS. In Work.
You need `MongoDB`, `MongoDB Compass`, `NodeJS` and `npm`.
## First of all
Create collection named __mytestingdb__, create some data looks like data in `kulinar.json` and named it __meal__ now we have:
>mytestingdb
>>mytestingdb.meal
### Last step
```
cd %root%
```
`npm i -s` and `npm run start`
